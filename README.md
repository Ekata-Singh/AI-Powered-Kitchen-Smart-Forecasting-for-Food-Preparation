# Problem Statement
# AI-Powered-Kitchen-Smart-Forecasting-for-Food-Preparation

In large-scale food service environments such as corporate cafeterias, university hostels, and institutional kitchens, food preparation is often based on manual estimations and guesswork. This traditional approach leads to two major problems: excess food waste when too much is prepared, and customer dissatisfaction when there’s too little. Both outcomes result in operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and environmental impact.

Despite the availability of data from previous meal cycles, footfall patterns, and known events, very few kitchens use predictive analytics to optimize their operations. Given the scale and variability of food demand, especially during events or season changes, there's a strong need for a smart, data-driven forecasting system.

This project aims to develop an AI-based solution that uses historical data, attendance trends, meal types, and contextual variables (e.g., event schedules, day of the week, weather) to predict the quantity of food that should be prepared. The goal is to minimize food waste, improve resource planning, and enhance overall kitchen efficiency.

By building a predictive model and integrating it with a user-friendly dashboard, the project envisions empowering kitchen staff to make informed decisions—bringing intelligence and automation to a traditionally manual process.
